    <!-- Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener 
        to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct 
        playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the 
        console.logs for this step)
    Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs 
    into DOM methods.
    Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game 
    once one player reaches 5 points. -->
