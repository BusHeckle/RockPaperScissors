// Create a new function named getComputerChoice.
// Write the code so that getComputerChoice will randomly return one of the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.
// Hint: The Math.random method returns a random number that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Think about how you can use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices.
// Test that your function returns what you expect using console.log or the browser developer tools before advancing to the next step.

// Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice
// Your game will be played by a human player. You will write a function that takes the user choice returns it.

// Create a new function named getHumanChoice.
// Write the code so that getHumanChoice will return one of the valid choices depending on what the user inputs.
// Hint: Use the prompt method to get the user’s input.
// Test what your function returns by using console.log.



// Step 4: Declare the players score variables
// Your game will keep track of the players score. You will write variables to keep track of the players score.

// Create two new variables named humanScore and computerScore in the global scope.
// Initialize those variables with the value of 0.

// Step 5: Write the logic to play a single round
// Your game will be played round by round. You will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, increments the round winner’s score and logs a winner announcement.

// Create a new function named playRound.
// Define two parameters for playRound: humanChoice and computerChoice. Use these two parameters to take the human and computer choices as arguments.
// Make your function’s humanSelection parameter case-insensitive so that players can input “rock”, “ROCK”, “RocK”, or other variations.
// Write the code for your playRound function to console.log a string value representing the round winner, such as: “You lose! Paper beats Rock”.
// Increment the humanScore or computerScore variable based on the round winner.


// Step 6: Write the logic to play the entire game
// Your game will play 5 rounds. You will write a function named playGame that calls playRound to play 5 rounds, keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end.

// Create a new function named playGame.
// Move your playRound function and score variables so that they’re declared inside of the new playGame function
// Play 5 rounds by calling playRound 5 times.
// Hint: When you assign a function call to a variable, the return value of that function is assigned to the variable. Accessing the variable afterward will only provide the assigned value; it doesn’t recall the function. You need to recall the choice functions to get new choices for each round.
// Re-work your previous functions or create more helper functions if necessary. Specifically, you may want to change the return values to something more useful.
// If you already know about loops, you can use them. If not, don’t worry! Loops will be covered in the next lesson.
